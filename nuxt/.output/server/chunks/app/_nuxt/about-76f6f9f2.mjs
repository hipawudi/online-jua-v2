The year 1970 saw the 2nd Asian Judo Championships (Men) in Kao-Hsiung , Taiwan , and the 3 rd Asian Judo Championships(Men) was held in Seoul , Korea in the year 1974. </p><p>\xA0</p><p> JUA Membership has been increasing year by year.

Judo is also a source of educational and character development. Prof. Kano emphasized that the efficient use of one\\&#39;s mind and body was the key to self-fulfillment. Judo, the first Olympic sport from Asia , is unique in its own way and sense. </p><p>\xA0</p><p> The origin and development of Judo as a combative sport demonstrates the superiority of technique over strength. The evolution of modern judo, was based on high ethical standards, and always gave due respect to its technical system and combative method. </p><p>\xA0</p><div class="text-xl font-bold text-red-500">Jujutsu becomes Judo</div><p><br> (as narrated by Prof. Jigoro Kano, Father of Modern Judo)<br> As extracted from &quot;Kodokan Judo Jigoro Kano&quot; </p><p><br> &quot;Most people are no doubt familiar with the words jujutsu and judo , but how many can distinguish between them? Here, I will explain the two terms and tell why judo came to take the place of jujutsu . </p><p>\xA0</p><p> Many martial arts were practiced in Japan during its feudal age: the use of the lance, archery, swordsmanship and many more. Jujutsu was one such art. Also called taijutsu and yawara , it was a system of attack that involved throwing, hitting, kicking, stabbing, slashing, choking, bending and twist\xADing limbs, pinning an opponent, and defenses against these attacks. Although jujutsu\\&#39;s techniques were known from the earliest times, it was not until the latter half of the sixteenth century that jujutsu was practiced and taught systematically. During the Edo period (1603-1868) it developed into a complex art taught by the masters of a number of schools. </p><p>\xA0</p><p> In my youth I studied jujutsu under many eminent masters. Their vast knowledge, the fruit of years of diligent research and rich experience, was of great value to me. At that time, each man presented his art as a collection of techniques. None perceived the guiding principle behind jujutsu. When I encountered differences in the teaching of techniques, I often found myself at a loss to know which was correct. This led me to look for an underlying principle in jujutsu, one that applied when one hit an opponent as well as when one threw him. After a thorough study of the subject, I discerned an all-pervasive principle: to make the most efficient use of mental and physical energy. With this principle in mind, I again reviewed all the methods of attack and defense I had learned, retaining only those that were in accordance with the principle. Those not in accord with it I rejected, and in their place I substituted techniques in which the principle was correctly applied. The resulting body of technique, which I named judo to distinguish it from its predecessor, is what is recognized as Judo.<br> \xA0 </p></div></div><div class="flex flex-col xl:flex-row gap-2"><div class="border-4 p-4 rounded-lg border-[#2e99b0] xl:w-1/2"><span class="mb-4 inline-block p-2 text-xl leading-5 font-medium uppercase rounded-xl text-red-500 bg-red-100">JUA Bank A/C Details</span><div class="flex flex-col text-lg gap-3"><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-3"><div class="md:w-1/2">Beneficiary&#39;s Account Name :</div><div class="w-1/2">JUDO UNION OF ASIA</div></div><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-3"><div class="md:w-1/2">Beneficiary&#39;s Account No. :</div><div class="w-1/2">KW73 COMB 0000 13 37 8604 5100 840 014</div></div><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-3"><div class="md:w-1/2">Beneficiary&#39;s Bank Name :</div><div class="w-1/2">Commercial Bank of Kuwait</div></div><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-3"><div class="md:w-1/2">Beneficiary&#39;s Bank Address :</div><div class="w-1/2">Sulaibikhat Branch, Kuwait</div></div><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-3"><div class="md:w-1/2">Beneficiary&#39;s Bank Swift Code :</div><div class="w-1/2">COMB KWKW</div></div><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-3"><div class="md:w-1/2">Address of the Judo Union of Asia :</div><div class="w-1/2"> P.O.
