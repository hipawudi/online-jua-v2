            Judo, the way of gentleness, which was created by Prof. Jigoro Kano from the
            martial arts, is an ideal form of physical exercise and self defense. Judo is
            also a source of educational and character development. Prof. Kano emphasized
            that the efficient use of one\'s mind and body was the key to
            self-fulfillment. Judo, the first Olympic sport from Asia , is unique in its
            own way and sense.

          <p>
            The origin and development of Judo as a combative sport demonstrates the
            superiority of technique over strength. The evolution of modern judo, was
            based on high ethical standards, and always gave due respect to its technical
            system and combative method.

            (as narrated by Prof. Jigoro Kano, Father of Modern Judo)<br />
            As extracted from "Kodokan Judo Jigoro Kano"

            "Most people are no doubt familiar with the words jujutsu and judo , but how
            many can distinguish between them? Here, I will explain the two terms and tell
            why judo came to take the place of jujutsu .
          </p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            Many martial arts were practiced in Japan during its feudal age: the use of
            the lance, archery, swordsmanship and many more. Jujutsu was one such art.
            Also called taijutsu and yawara , it was a system of attack that involved
            throwing, hitting, kicking, stabbing, slashing, choking, bending and twistÂ­ing
            limbs, pinning an opponent, and defenses against these attacks. Although
            jujutsu\'s techniques were known from the earliest times, it was not until the
            latter half of the sixteenth century that jujutsu was practiced and taught
            systematically. During the Edo period (1603-1868) it developed into a complex
            art taught by the masters of a number of schools.
          </p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            In my youth I studied jujutsu under many eminent masters. Their vast
            knowledge, the fruit of years of diligent research and rich experience, was of
            great value to me. At that time, each man presented his art as a collection of
            techniques. None perceived the guiding principle behind jujutsu. When I
            encountered differences in the teaching of techniques, I often found myself at
            a loss to know which was correct. This led me to look for an underlying
            principle in jujutsu, one that applied when one hit an opponent as well as
            when one threw him. After a thorough study of the subject, I discerned an
            all-pervasive principle: to make the most efficient use of mental and physical
            energy. With this principle in mind, I again reviewed all the methods of
            attack and defense I had learned, retaining only those that were in accordance
            with the principle. Those not in accord with it I rejected, and in their place
            I substituted techniques in which the principle was correctly applied. The
            resulting body of technique, which I named judo to distinguish it from its
            predecessor, is what is recognized as Judo.<br />
