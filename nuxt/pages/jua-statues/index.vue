            Judo Union of Asia &nbsp;is composed of National Judo Federations in Asian
            Countries and Regions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each National Federation must be recognized as the sole federation authorized
            to represent its country in international sporting bodies by its Olympic
            Committee, which itself is duly recognized by the International Olympic
            Committee or Olympic Council of Asia.<br />
            These Judo Union of Asia will implement the &nbsp;policy of the International
            Judo Federation towards Judo diffusion.
          </p>

          <p>
            Judo was created in 1882 by Professor Jigoro Kano.&nbsp; As an educational
            method derived from the martial arts, judo became an official Olympic sport in
            1964 (after being named as a demonstration sport at the 1940 Tokyo Olympic
            Games which were cancelled due to international conflict).&nbsp; Judo is a
            highly codified sport in which the mind controls the expression of the body
            and is a sport which contributes to educating individuals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond competitions and combat, judo involves technical research, practice of
            katas, self-defense work, physical preparation and sharpening of spirit.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a discipline derived from ancestral traditions, judo was designed by its
            Master Founder as an eminently modern and progressive activity.
